driver1 also named cfs.dll, using handle Htsysm72FB, looks to be capcom.sys.
driver1 has no exports
driver2 exports DriverBootstrap


the com dll extends iUnknown and you can see that in the vftable because you can see the iUnknown methods, then you can see 2 custom functions. the first takes data out of Password regkey and generates an Rc4 S-box out of the data then puts it into a passed in buffer. the second function takes the S-box as an argument and decrypts some hardcoded data and places it into the Flag regkey.

the driver that gets loaded decrypts the data that is expected to be in Password and leaves it in a stack buffer until that stack frame is destroyed. so to get it, you need to get lucky on a kernel memory dump or debug the kernel and view that buffer after the decryption.
