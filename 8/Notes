1. identify windows subsystem for linux using the embedded guids and install it


dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

we can easy hot-patch the elf file that gets dropped by the exe because its unencrypted in the rsrc section. it would be harder to try to patch it and splice it in.

answer:
since the goal is to play tic-tac-toe and win, the goal should be to find the logic which plays for X. that is found at the top of main, first X will try to take the middle, then it will look for the player having 2 in a row anywhere, then it will try to take the corners. the simplest solution is to edit the logic that search for 2 in a row. i changed the 2 to a 3 for horizontal victories, thus making it too late by the time the computer would notice.
